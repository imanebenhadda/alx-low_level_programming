# 0x1E-search_algorithms
## Overview:
This directory contains C language implementations of various search algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to efficiently locate elements within a collection of data. Each algorithm is designed to solve different types of search problems and has its own set of strengths and weaknesses.

## Contents:

### 0-linear.c:
Implementation of linear search algorithm.
Time complexity: O(n)

### 1-binary.c:
Implementation of binary search algorithm.
Assumes the input array is sorted.
Time complexity: O(log n)

### 2-O(logn).c:
Implementation of a custom search algorithm with O(log n) time complexity.
Details about the specific algorithm are documented within the file.

### 3-O(sqrt(n)).c:
Implementation of a custom search algorithm with O(sqrt(n)) time complexity.
Details about the specific algorithm are documented within the file.

## How to Use:
- Each C file contains a standalone implementation of a search algorithm.
- Compile the C file using a C compiler, for example:

$ gcc -o 0-linear 0-linear.c
Run the compiled executable to test the algorithm:
$ ./0-linear

## Notes:
The C files are well-commented to provide detailed explanations of the algorithms and their implementations.
Feel free to explore and modify these implementations for educational or practical purposes.
